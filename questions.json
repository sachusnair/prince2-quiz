It influences how \u201cthe principles, practices and processes are applied by the people involved to ensure that the method is fit for the project context\u201d. Ref 1.2 B. Incorrect. The PRINCE2 Project Management practices \u201cdescribe essential aspects of project management that must be applied consistently and throughout the project lifecycle. The seven practices explain the specific treatment required of that aspect of project management for the PRINCE2 Project Management processes to be effective and why they are necessary\u201d. Ref 1.2 C. Incorrect. \u201cThe seven processes describe the entire project lifecycle, from activities before getting started, through the stages of project delivery, and to the final act of project closure. Each process has checklists of recommended activities and related responsibilities.\u201d Ref 1.2 D. Incorrect. The \u2018people\u2019 element covers \u201cthose working on the project and those affected by the project.
